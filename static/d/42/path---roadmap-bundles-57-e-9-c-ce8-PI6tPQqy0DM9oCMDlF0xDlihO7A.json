For us, content is not only regular documentation but also specifications and contextual help.\nDue to the nature of the content and the number of different areas it sits in, the Core and Supporting capability provides also many generic tools that not only support content but also other aspects of the product.\n\nIn other words, if some content must be displayed in a given UI, the capability cares also about the rest of the UI of a given business functionality and its backend.\n\n## Vision\n\n- Content is written once and reused in different contexts in an efficient way on the documentation portal, as the inline help, or in the UI applications. In other words, we provide a headless CMS that is an abstraction layer on top of a more generic files storage solution that allows you to store any static content, such as client-side applications. This is possible because of:\n  - The Kubernetes-native way of delivering content that supports distributed content sourcing and modularity. It means that content is delivered only if the documented component is enabled.\n  - Generic reusable UI components for rendering documentation and specifications that are reusable in any context. For example, you can use them in the Service Catalog view to display documentation for ServiceClasses and their instances or in the Applications view to display the documentation of connected applications.\n  - Providing the UI support for rendering specifications such as Swagger for REST API, EDM for OData, or AsyncApi for any kind of asynchronous communication.\n  - The backend that allows for the reuse of content and specification details in any UI context.\n- To support the out-of-the-box rendering of content in the Console UI and also make it easy for the Kyma users to generate a standalone documentation portal for their services.\n- To support easy content development, enable templates integration, and allow for previewing the content before publishing.\n- To support automated content validation, like links, grammar, consistency, and specification compliance.\n\n\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/undefined/core-and-supporting","type":"core-and-supporting"},"frontmatter":{"displayName":"Core & Supporting","epicsLabels":["area/core-and-supporting","area/community"],"id":"core-and-supporting"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n## Scope\n\nThe Service Management capability wraps up the Service Catalog and the Service Brokers concepts. It enables applications that run in Kubernetes clusters to easily use internally and externally managed software offerings, such as a datastore service offered by a cloud provider. It also provides a way to list, provision, and automatically bind applications with services from the Service Brokers, with no need for detailed knowledge about how those services are created or managed.\n\n## Vision\n\nThe goal of the Service Management capability is to:\n* Ensure a well-configured and hardened installation of the Service Catalog.\n* Provide simple and self-guided Service Catalog UI flows.\n* Assure that the Service Catalog UI functionality always goes hand in hand with the Service Catalog CLI.\n* Support the Service Catalog with UI as a stand-alone solution.\n* Support automated service binding injection into various types of Kubernetes applications. \n* Allow registering new types of Kubernetes applications at runtime.\n* Enable connected remote applications in the Service Catalog using the Application Broker.\n* Enable extending the Service Catalog offerings with services that will be installed in Kubernetes using the Helm Broker and the `bundles` repository.\n* Provide a set of reusable services as bundles that will extend the Kyma installation.\n* Allow users to choose a set of Namespaces where a given Service Broker will be automatically registered and available. \n* Allow users to reduce a number of Service Classes that will be exposed by a given Broker.\n* Assure that the Service Catalog UI component for bindings is used in Deployment, Function, and other types of applications UI views.\n\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/undefined/service-management","type":"service-management"},"frontmatter":{"displayName":"Service Management","epicsLabels":["area/service-catalog"],"id":"service-management"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"capabilitiesNavigation":[{"displayName":"Console / Microfrontends","id":"console-microfrontends"},{"displayName":"Core & Supporting","id":"core-and-supporting"},{"displayName":"Service Management","id":"service-management"}],"ids":{"Console / Microfrontends":"console-microfrontends","Core & Supporting":"core-and-supporting","Service Management":"service-management"},"ticket":{"title":"Provide AWS Service Broker bundle","body":"**Description**\r\n\r\nProvide AWS Service Broker installation at runtime.\r\n\r\n**Reasons**\r\n\r\nAllow Kyma users to integrate AWS Service Broker with Kyma in an easy way with well documented steps described in a documentation of the service class.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria**\r\n- Make a bundle for AWS Service Broker\r\n  - keep all naming conventions, like description etc synced with already existing Azure and GCP bundles\r\n  - check if bundle requires some input parameters (for example Azure Broker has such one)\r\n  - bundle itself implementation and doc\r\n- Create service class documentation for above bundle\r\n  - add documentation per every AWS class, use reference to AWS documentation\r\n- Make sure all input parameters are displayed correctly in Service Catalog UI\r\n- release bundles repository and use new version in Kyma\r\n- Keep bundle AWS image/chart version and docs with the same version\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Attachments**\r\n- Documentation, see: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker/tree/master/docs\r\n- Installation on Kubernetes, see: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker/blob/master/docs/getting-started-k8s.md","url":"https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/issues/57","number":57,"labels":["area/service-catalog"],"githubUrl":"https://github.com/kyma-project/bundles/issues/57","repository":{"name":"bundles","id":151691065,"issues":[]},"dueDate":"2019-05-10T10:00:00.000Z","zenHubUrl":"https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/kyma---all-repositories-5b6d5985084045741e744dea/issues/kyma-project/bundles/57","release":{"release_id":"5c86318b1aa06e798dcd6782","title":"1.1","description":"Release 1.1 - Helsinki","start_date":"2019-04-06T22:00:00.000Z","desired_end_date":"2019-05-10T10:00:00.000Z","created_at":"2019-03-11T09:59:39.887Z","closed_at":null,"state":"open"},"capability":{"displayName":"Service Management","epicsLabels":["area/service-catalog"],"id":"service-management"}},"locale":"en"}}
